yet to do for all archs:

    + add "strlen" to "center"
    + remove "put_char"


Optimizations Possible but not done:
   + custom ELF header (instead of using "ld" to link) can take up
     to 400 bytes off of the ix86 assembly.

Optimizations Used for size:

   x86:
        + "push $smallval; pop %eax" smaller than "mov $smallval,%eax"
	+ "mov $(value>>8), %ah" smaller than "mov $value, %ax"
	  (only can be done if lower 8 bits of value zero)
	+ "xor %ebx,%ebx" is smaller than "mov $0,%ebx"
	+ "or ah,ah" is NOT smaller than "cmp $0,ah"
