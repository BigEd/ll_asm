These are binaries for ll, which are versions of the linux_logo
programmed in assembly language (and optimized for size).

Native versions, that is versions you'd run on an actual machine that
read from /proc/cpuinfo natively, are in ./native

Versions that read from proc/* (a local directory instead) are found
under qemu_test and are suitable for testing simulators that do Linux 
syscall emulation, such as qemu-linux-user.
