Background
~~~~~~~~~~

I have translated the same program into assembly language on 20+
different architectures.  These are all optimized for size, and
are made as small as possible.  When possible these are tested
on real hardware, but when that's not available they are tested
on simulators.

These can be useful for doing quick sanity checks of various Linux
user-space emulators.  These executables read cpuinfo from a 
local file, not from /proc/cpuinfo.  That way they can be run under 
a simulator.


Testing QEMU
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The test_qemu.sh script can be used to quickly test all of the 
architectures.  Edit the test.include file first to point
to your copy of qemu.

You can also cd into the various directories and run "test.sh".

Included are all of the architectures currently supported by qemu.

Current status running under git x86_64 qemu (17 September 2009):
  + alpha       -- works
  + arm         -- works
  + arm_thumb   -- works
  + cris        -- works (toolchain problem causes qemu to error out on mmap?)
  + i386        -- works
  + m68k        -- qemu support missing instructions
  + microblaze  -- works
  + mips        -- works
  + mipsel      -- works
  + ppc         -- works
  + s390        -- untested, s390 support not merged into qemu yet
  + sh4         -- works
  + sparc32plus -- works
  + x86_64      -- works


Testing M5
~~~~~~~~~~

use the "test_m5.sh" script.

As of 17 September 2009:
  + Alpha works
  + ARM works
  + MIPSEL works
  + SPARC gets the memory size wrong
  + X86 works
