yes, I am insane

Tired of waiting many miliseconds for linux_logo to run?
Tired of wasting 35k of disk space?
Upset that to run linux_logo you need huge GLIBC?

Well your worries are over!

With "ll"  [even the name was shortened to save space!] you get all of the
benefits of linux_logo in a smaller, faster package!

"ll" is written entirely in 32-bit Linux x86 assembly-language!
BONUS: now included is also a PowerPC assembly language version!


Features:
+ Runs in 4 miliseconds, more than twice as fast as the 10 linux_logo takes 
  on a K6-2+ 450!
+ Takes up only 2.6k when stripped!  This is small enough to fit in one 4k 
  x86 memory page!
  
Amaze your enemies!  Impress your friends!

FEATURES:
	Point the "ANSI_TO_USE" variable in the Makefile to any text
	or ansi file you want when building.

BUGS:
	No pretty-printing: This means that your computer is reported just
                            as /proc/cpuinfo reports, ugly model-name, off 
			    MHz, and all.

	Doesn't work on >1GB systems: This is because I was lazy and didn't
                                      want to do a 16bit divide in the 
				      binary->decimal converter.  If there's
				      enough demand I can probably fix this 
				      up in a few bytes.
			    
	Possibly kernel-dependent:  I only tested this on 2.4.x kernels.

HOW TO HELP:
	Feel free to contribute code for other architectures!
	SPARC, ARM, ALPHA, and MIPS would be much appreciated.
