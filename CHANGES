5 March 2002
+ Start work on the ppc version

8 March 2002
+ RLE (run-length-encode) compressed the logo.  Cuts 1.3k off the
  size of the intel binary

11 March 2002
+ Convert from nasm to 'gas' as the assembler.  Yes, I know, ick, ick, ick,
  but it wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be.
+ added "configure.c" which will detect architecture and compile correct
  assembly file

13 March 2002
+ Finally have ppc version all working

6 May 2002
+ Add ansi_rle.c program which will convert any ansi into a form
  suitable to use with ll
+ Re-wrote the code a bit to handle generic ANSI sequences, not just
  color-changes anymore

7 May 2002
+ Make 'll' return to normal plain console color after running
