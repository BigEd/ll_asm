5 March 2002
+ Start work on the ppc version

8 March 2002
+ RLE (run-length-encode) compressed the logo.  Cuts 1.3k off the
  size of the intel binary

11 March 2002
+ Convert from nasm to 'gas' as the assembler.  Yes, I know, ick, ick, ick,
  but it wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be.
+ added "configure.c" which will detect architecture and compile correct
  assembly file

13 March 2002
+ Finally have ppc version all working

6 May 2002
+ Add ansi_rle.c program which will convert any ansi into a form
  suitable to use with ll
+ Re-wrote the code a bit to handle generic ANSI sequences, not just
  color-changes anymore

7 May 2002
+ Make 'll' return to normal plain console color after running

RELEASE 0.5

5 June 2002
+ Add Alpha version.  Thanks to the compaq test drive people

RELEASE 0.6

8 June 2002
+ Add ia64 version.  Thanks again to compaq test drive.

RELEASE 0.7

2 July 2002
+ Add SPARC version

RELEASE 0.8

26 July 2002
+ Import "configure" from linux_logo-4.03
+ Optimize 208bytes off of ix86 code, thanks to suggestions from
  Stephan Walter <stephan.walter _at_ gmx.ch>
+ Add the RiSC port to the 16bit directory  

RELEASE 0.9

2 August 2002
+ added s390 support

RELEASE 0.10

8 August 2002
+ Add "lzss" logo support and convert ix86 over to new code
  (with much help from Stephan Walter).

RELEASE 0.11

22 August 2002
+ Have ix86 code down to 1476 bytes!
+ Have partially working PPC version of lzss code

28 August 2002
+ Update s390 to lzss before my testdrive account expires
+ Update ix86 comments a bit

10 September 2002
+ re-written PPC code is 1796 bytes!
+ release 0.12

RELEASE 0.12

27 September 2002
+ added "sstrip" utility by Brian Raiter which really reduces the size
+ got the ix86 code to 1021 bytes!!! thanks to Stephan Walter again,
  but also I re-wrote the lzss core and did some tricks myself

RELEASE 0.13

16 December 2002
+ Thanks to Stephan Walter again for getting the ix86 code down to
  993 bytes.
* Worked on the code myself and got it down to 977 by using edx as a
  function pointer and using 2-byte call *%edx.  The ix86 code
  is becoming so optimized as to be unreadable...
  
RELEASE 0.14

13 January 2006
+ Mips version working.  Should optimize for size a bit. 
  It is based off of the x86 code so uses the more optimized
  LZSS logo.
+ Work on the PPC version which stopped working, apparently
  because the "ctr" register is not saved across a syscall with
  kernel 2.6.  Interesting.
  
19 May 2006
+ Start work on the HP PA-RISC version
+ Fix up the infrastructure to special-case the weird .EQU
  directive order the hppa arch needs.
  
13 January 2007
+ Work on PA-RISC again after long delay.  Have it working, but not optimized
  
RELEASE 0.15
RELEASE 0.16

29 January 2007
+ Optimized PA-RISC code.  sstrip'd version before was 2096 bytes, after is
  1432 bytes.

RELEASE 0.17

2 Feburary 2007
+ Change the way the Makefile detects architecture
+ x86 ll was crashing on newer machines with really stupid cpuinfo cpu types
  (core2 and newer xeons, I'm looking at you).  The problem was it makes
  the middle string >80, which the check for was broken.  Fix, but it
  adds an extra 3 bytes to program length.

3 February 2007
+ x86_64 version.  Hoped I could make it smaller, but for various reasons
  it ends up being a tens of bytes bigger than x86 version.  Try 
  various optimizations to no avail.

RELEASE 0.18

6 February 2007
+ Re-optimize the mips version.  It is now 160 bytes smaller.

RELEASE 0.19

9 February 2007
+ Fix branch-delay slot optimization in strcat in MIPS.
  Binary now 16 bytes smaller!
+ Re-optimize SPARC version.
+ Added a FAQ.

RELEASE 0.20

16 February 2007
+ Start optimizing Alpha code

17 February 2007
+ Finish optimizing Alpha code.  It could use another pass though.

RELEASE 0.21

27 February 2007
+ Have ARM completely working.
+ Started on arm thumb version, but on my development board the kernel isn't
  compiled with thumb support, and I'm a bit wary of flashing the boot flash.
  I'll try to get a kernel booted off a CF card at some point.

RELEASE 0.22

11 March 2007
+ Thumb support working.  Wasted a day chasing down an off-by-one
  loop thinko with strcat.
+ Optimized thumb support.
  
RELEASE 0.23
  
22 March 2007
+ Update itanium code to use LZSS logo.  It's the last of the RLE
  executables.

RELEASE 0.24

24 April 2007
+ Get aranym going for m68k emulation.

26 April 2007
+ Initial m68k work

27 Aptil 2007
+ m68k version finished

28 April 2007
+ Optimized m68k version

RELEASE 0.25

6 July 2007
+ Have VAX "hello world" stub going
+ Also have avr32 "hello world" going

8 July 2007
+ avr32 working
+ super-optimized avr32 and got it to 914 bytes, a new record!

RELEASE 0.27 (there was no 0.26)

30 July 2007
+ Got the hercules s390 emulator working.

1 August 2007
+ re-optimized s390.  Now all of the architectures are using
  the "new" lzss format and all have a similar code base.

RELEASE 0.28

3 August 2007
+ Update x86 to work with modern cpuinfos.  Also properly prints
  plurals like other SMP supporting archs.  This added ~30 bytes
  to the executable.  This potentially broke older (as in 386 and 486)
  support, but it fixes core duo and other newer machines.
  I wish Intel would stop coming up with stupid cpu name fields.
+ Update x86_64 to match the changes in x86

6 August 2007
+ Got vax fully working

7 August 2007
+ Optimized vax

RELEASE 0.29
