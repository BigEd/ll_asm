This directory contains an implementation of ll in 6502 assembly language
for the Apple II series of computers.

The same LZSS data from the Linux version is used and decoded.  The resulting
 ANSI text is converted to HIRES graphics and printed to the screen.
Some simple system info is detected and printed, though it is of 
 questionable accuracy.

Building:
   You need to install the cc65 toolchain
       http://www.cc65.org/
   And the dos33fs tools
       http://www.deater.net/weave/vmwprod/apple/dos33fs.html
       
   Run "make"
   Then run "make disk"
   Which will copy the executable to the disk image ll_6502.dsk
   
   To run, you can copy the executable to an actual Apple II, or else
     use your favorite Apple II emulator on "ll_6502.dsk"
