ll.RiSC.s is assembler for the educational RiSC architecture.
Information on this can be found at http://www.engr.umd.edu/~blj/RiSC/
The assembler there should be able to compile this source. 
To run it you will need to make a standard simulator that believes
"nand 0,0,0" mimicks the Linux syscall instruction.  For a working
simulator e-mail me.
